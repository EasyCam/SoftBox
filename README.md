# SoftBox


SoftBox is a tool for photographer to use Screen as a light box. This is also an extreme exercise of PyQt. I am really a idiot on programming. So just don't give any attention please.

> 我灯箱坏掉了，不方便看胶片。然后我想着用屏幕来做灯箱看胶片，结果发现 App Store 里面的还要十几块。作为一个穷人，我只能想别的办法，于是就尝试用 PyQt 来弄个试试。
> 我是一个纯外行，然后代码能力自然是渣渣负无穷，所以希望牛人高手们饶过我，忽略我就可以了，谢谢。



## Installation

```Bash
pip install softbox
```

## Usage in Python interpreter

After the installation step above, SoftBox now becomes available in Python. And you can simply use it by type the following commands in your Python interpreter :


```Bash
import sys
import geopython as gp
sys.exit(gp.begin())
```
