# SoftBox


SoftBox is a tool for photographer to use Screen as a light box. This is also an extreme exercise of PyQt. I am really a idiot on programming. So just don't give any attention please.




## Installation

```Bash
pip install softbox
```

## Usage in Python interpreter

After the installation step above, SoftBox now becomes available in Python. And you can simply use it by type the following commands in your Python interpreter :


```Bash
import sys
import softbox as sb
sys.exit(sb.begin())
```
